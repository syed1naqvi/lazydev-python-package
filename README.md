## Usage Guide

### 1. Generate a Lazy Commit Message

# generate a random commit message
print(lazy_commit_message())

# generate a commit message with a keyword
print(lazy_commit_message(keyword="HOTFIX"))

HOTFIX: I patched the function. Maybe this will work?
```

### 2. Generate a Lazy Pull Request Title
```
from lazydev import lazy_pull_request

# generate a random pull request title for github
print(lazy_pull_request())

# generate a pull request title with a custom verb and noun
print(lazy_pull_request(inputVerb="improved", inputNoun="error handling"))
```

#### Example Output:
```
Fixed a bug. Just accept the pull request.
Improved error handling to align with new version.
```

### 3. Generate a Lazy Test Excuse
```
from lazydev import lazy_test_excuse

# Generate a random test excuse
print(lazy_test_excuse())

# Generate a test excuse with a specific reason
print(lazy_test_excuse(reason="ran out of coffee"))
```

#### Example Output
```
I'll add tests later...
I was going to write tests, but ran out of coffee.
```

### 4. Get a Procrastination Tip

from lazydev import procrastination_tip

# Generate a random procrastination tip
print(procrastination_tip())

# Generate a procrastination tip with a keyword
print(procrastination_tip(keyword="BREAK TIME"))

```
